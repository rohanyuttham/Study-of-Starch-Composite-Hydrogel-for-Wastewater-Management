Study of Starch Composite Hydrogel for Wastewater Management | Prof. Gaurav Goel , IIT Delhi
May 2018 â€“ October 2018
- Studied the interaction between Thermoplastic Starch (TPS), Water, and Clay nanoparticles in a simulated environment
- The prepared starch system was studied for the adsorption of heavy metals like lead and mercury present in wastewater
- Created topology files for a hydrogel in a simulated environment in the Gromacs software. It was tested for the adsorption of heavy metals on its surface
